Cold Email Message
I saw your Linkedin post about the Product Manager, Monetization role on your team.

I've been at SoundCloud (50M+ MAUs) as a Growth PM for the past 2.6 years, where my core focus was on user retention and monetization. 

I was promoted twice during my tenure and my team's work grew to contribute over 12% of SoundCloud's annual revenue while making significant impacts on our core retention and monetization metrics. I've relentlessly worked on building hypothesis-driven teams that are effective at growing the funnel and collaborating cross-functionally with multiple stakeholders. 

I'm leaving SoundCloud soon and am looking for new opportunities for both personal and professional growth. Slack is a product that I love and use everyday, so I'd be very excited to work on it. If you think my background makes sense, could you give me a shot at interviewing for the role? 

I've attached my resume to this email. You can also find me on LinkedIn and Github.

I look forward to hearing back from you. Either way, keep building awesome things at Slack.

Warm regards,
