# cold-message-templates
Here are templates you can use for outreach to hiring managers and recruiters for jobs. These templates are written in the style best suited for each platform. For example, Twitter is less formal and more conversational vs. Linkedin which is more formal and less conversational. 

**Here are some other tips:** 
- Use ChatGPT or Claude to further refine the message
- Always personalize the message to the person, role, and company you are applying to.
- Don't make a paragraph longer than 2 sentences. If longer, split into 2 paragraphs. 
- Always attach your resume and website to the message (and cover letter if applicable) 
- Don't get attached to outcomes, get attached to inputs. You can't control if/how someone responds, but you can control the # of people you send to, the quality of your message, how long you keep at it, etc.
