Cold Linkedin Message

Hi [name], 
I'm going to keep this short and to the point. I just applied to the X role in NYC. I read your AMA on growthhackers.com and was intrigued by the process, analytics, and tools you use to grow SoundCloud. 

As an artist and listener for over 5 years, I've always dreamed of working at SoundCloud. I'm confident I would learn so much in such a short period of time while being a value-add to the team.

I'd normally go through company referrals but I do not know anyone that works at Soundcloud. If you could please look over my resume and cover letter and refer me to the appropriate hiring team member I would greatly appreciate it.

Even if I don't get the position, I'd love to meet with you to discuss some feature ideas I have for SoundCloud to grow its user base. 

Happy Holidays [name]!
